# ML

Use ML algorithms to:
- Learn the historical grid energy demand data, predict comming energy demand in hours.
- Learn and predict future solar & wind total energy generation according to input real-time weather data, predict energy shortage possibility for different areas, dynamically balance energy or change charging priority between energy stations and their storage systems in advance.
- Learn and predict battery energy storage system charging remain time.
- Learn and tune the charge and discharge scheduling & balancing algorithm to maximaze energy efficiency and battery lifespan. (minimizing charging time, maximizing energy transfer efficiency, and reducing heat generation during charging).
- Learn batteries degradation trend, predict batteries remain lifespan and provide maintenance suggestions.
- Identify State of Health (SOH) of batteries, and classify batteries into different Tiers.
