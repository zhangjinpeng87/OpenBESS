# ML

Use ML Regression algorithms to:
- Learn battery charge voltage and current curve
- Learn battery discharge voltage and current curve
- Learn batteries degradation trend, predict batteries remain lifespan
- Learn feedbacks of different balancing algorigthms, to maximaze energy efficiency and battery lifespan

Use ML Clustering and Classification algorithms to:
- Identify State of Health (SOH) of batteries, and classify batteries into different Tiers
