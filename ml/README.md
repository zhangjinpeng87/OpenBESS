# ML

Use ML Clustering and Classification algorithms to:
- Identify State of Health (SOH) of batteries, and then classify batteries into different clusters
- Degradation trend of different batteries, and then classify them into different Tiers

Learn feedbacks of different balancing algorigthms, to maximaze energy efficiency and battery lifespan
