# Spark

Use spark run daily data analysis jobs:
- Calculate highest voltage, lowest voltage, max current, peak temperature and other useful data for battery cells every day. If some of these battery cells have higher frequency to reach peak temperature then other batteries, these cells probably have health issue.
- Calculate the total energy come in / out every day for different stations, different containers, even different packs, to have a whole picture of how these energy are distributed and flowed. In this way we may identify some unreasonable energy balancing issues.
- Calculate the charge/discharge cycles of each battery cells, predict the estimate remain lifespan of batteries.
- Monitor the characteristics (highest voltage, ...) changing trend to predict state-of-health(SOH) of batteries.
- And more...
