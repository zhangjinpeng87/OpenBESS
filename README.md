# OpenBMS
OpenBMS is a open source battery management system(BMS), aim to provide BMS for grid storage, electric vehicles, and other battery energy storage systems.

## Data Store
- Implement robust data management for monitoring and collecting data from individual batteries.
- Support store time series data locally and upload data to cloud storage like S3.

## Intelligent and Predictive Operations
- Process collected data with ML and statistic algorithms, to predict the remain lifetime of each battery pack, and provide maintenance suggestions in advance.
- Adjust system parameters in real-time based on changing environmental conditions, grid requirements, and battery characteristics.
- Analyze operational data to identify opportunities for improving overall energy efficiency, suggesting adjustments in the system configuration or operation.

## State of Charge Calculation
- Develop algorithms for accurate SoC calculations based on battery voltage, current, and temperature measurements.
- Consider incorporating advanced techniques like Kalman filters for better estimation.

## Balancing and Equalization:
- Implement balancing algorithms to ensure that individual cells within a battery pack are charged and discharged uniformly.
- Consider equalization strategies to prolong the overall battery life.

## Energy Management
- Optimize energy usage based on grid demand and supply.
- Implement algorithms for determining when to charge and discharge batteries to maximize efficiency.

## Temperature Management:
- Monitor and control battery temperatures to optimize performance and prevent overheating.
- Implement thermal management strategies to ensure safe operation.
