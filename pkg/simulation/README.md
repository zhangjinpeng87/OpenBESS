# Simulation Package

This package is used to simulate the behavior of a set of battery sensors, the simulator can continously generate battery state events for hundreds of thounsand faked sensors concurrently. We can configure different patterns / cases for the behavior: normal charge, normal discharge, imbalance state of change, battery capacity degradation, etc.
