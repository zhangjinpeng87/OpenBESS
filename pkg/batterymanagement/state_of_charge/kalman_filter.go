// For statistics and control theory, Kalman filtering, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE),
// is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, including statistical noise and
// other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than 
// those based on a single measurement alone, by estimating a joint probability distribution over the 
// variables for each timeframe. The filter is named after Rudolf E. Kálmán, who was one of the primary 
// developers of its theory.
